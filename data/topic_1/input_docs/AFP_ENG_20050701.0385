<P>
Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman 
appointed to the US Supreme Court and a frequent swing vote, has 
announced her retirement, a court source said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Her retirement, which sets up a long-awaited political battle 
for a successor and gives President George W. Bush his first chance 
to select a justice for the high court, was confirmed by a Supreme 
Court official who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
As rival groups geared up for what is likely to be a bitter 
nomination battle, Bush scheduled a news conference for 11:15 am 
(1515 GMT) in the White House Rose Garden, his spokesman Scott 
McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, 75, who is considered a moderate conservative, was 
appointed to the court by president Ronald Reagan and took her seat 
in September 1981.
</P>
<P>
Her retirement gives Bush the chance to shape the ideological 
balance of the court, a fact that could spark a prolonged 
confirmation battle in the US Senate for a successor, touching on 
lightning bolt questions such as abortion and the separation of 
church and state.
