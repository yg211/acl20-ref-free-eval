Sandra Day O'Connor, the first 
woman ever appointed to the US Supreme Court, said Friday that she
is retiring, giving US president George W. Bush his first 
opportunity to appoint a justice.
</P>
<P>
"This is to inform you of my decision to retire from my 
position as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the 
United States, effective upon the nomination and confirmation of 
my successor," she said in a letter to Bush.
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, 75, did not explain why she was resigning. A Supreme 
Court spokeswoman said O'Connor needs to spend time with her 
husband who suffered from Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
Her resignation, which will result in the first opening on the 
US Supreme Court in 11 years, will allow Bush to make his first 
appointment to the nine-member court which makes many vital 
decisions concerning US society. Experts said the appointment is 
set to trigger fierce political battle between the Republicans and
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
In a statement confirming O'Connor's resignation, Bush said he 
will pick her successor in a timely manner so her vacancy can be 
filled by the time the court resumes work in October.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to "be deliberate and thorough" in making the 
choice and will consult with the Senate which will confirm his 
nominee.
