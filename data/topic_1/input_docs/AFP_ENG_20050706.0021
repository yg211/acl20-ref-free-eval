Abortion issue rallies conservatives, liberals ahead of Supreme 
Court fight

<P>
The perennial battle over abortion 
rights in the United States is galvanizing conservative and liberal 
activists, who are hoping to influence President George W. Bush's 
choice to fill a newly-vacated US Supreme Court seat.
</P>
<P>
For decades, a deep ideological rift over a woman's right to end 
an unwanted pregnancy has cleaved this country into two powerful, 
and equally-impassioned camps.
</P>
<P>
Conservatives, who turned out in record numbers to cast votes 
last November for the Republican president, see in the retirement of 
moderate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor a historic chance to reshape 
the nine-member high court, and fulfill a fervent wish to overturn 
the watershed Roe v. Wade Supreme Court case which guaranteed women 
the right to an abortion.
</P>
<P>
Liberals, meanwhile, have sternly warned Bush not to name an 
"extremist" to the court and have vowed to put up a fierce fight to 
safeguard the right to legal abortion.
</P>
<P>
With a Supreme Court seat now open for the first time in more 
than a decade, groups on both sides of the bitter abortion divide 
have said they are planning to spend millions to lobby Congress and 
the White House, and to rally their supporters. 
</P>
<P>
Political observers predicted Armaggedon once the fight to 
replace O'Connor is joined in earnest, with dozens of political 
groups expected to play a role.
</P>
<P>
"I think we're in for a pretty partisan battle," said Orrin 
Hatch, a conservative US senator and longserving member of the 
powerful Senate Judiciary committee that will vet US President 
George W. Bush's eventual Supreme Court nominee.
</P>
<P>
The debate also is expect to further polarize an already-divided 
US Senate which will be called upon to confirm the president's 
pick.
</P>
<P>
"He said he's going to pick a strong conservative, and I think 
that's going to cause a battle no matter what," Hatch told ABC 
television Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Even before O'Connor announced her departure, the conservative 
Progress for America group last month launched a 700,000-dollar 
fundraising effort, hoping to beat back "liberal attack groups ... 
hungry to smear almost any potential candidate for the Supreme Court 
who doesn't meet their left-wing, extemist litmus test."
</P>
<P>
Likewise, the Family Research Council said on its website that 
it is "primed for the fight it will take to confirm a nominee," and 
vowed to mobilize 20,000 churches across the nation to lobby for a 
conservative justice.
</P>
<P>
Liberal groups were equally motivated: The pro-choice Feminist 
Majority sounded the alarm within hours of O'Connor announcing her 
retirement.
</P>
<P>
"This is it! The worst has happened with the resignation of 
Sandra Day OConnor," the group said on its website.
</P>
<P>
"Let there be no mistake about it: Sandra Day OConnor was the 
fifth vote that was saving Roe vs. Wade," the group said in a dire 
warning to its supporters. 
</P>
<P>
"Abortion rights and womens rights are on the line."
</P>
<P>
Another liberal group, MoveOn.org said on its website that it 
aimed to deliver 300,000 petition signatures by Tuesday to the US 
Senate, asking lawmakers to help preserve the right to end a 
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
And the left-leaning "Ms." magazine this month warned its 
readers that "rolling back reproductive rights is only the first act 
in a nightmare scenario that could come to pass if right-wing judges 
take over the federal courts and the nations highest court."
</P>
<P>
Bush said in a newspaper interview published Tuesday that he 
expected to have a new justice on the bench by October, and already 
had identified "a good-sized" number of prospects.
</P>
<P>
The US president called on partisan groups to tone down the 
heated rhetoric, insisting in an interview USA Today that he is 
immune to the high-intensity lobbying.
</P>
<P>
"I feel no pressure, except the pressure to put somebody on the 
bench who will bring dignity to the office, somebody who's got the 
intellect necessary to do the job, somebody of great integrity and 
somebody who will faithfully interpret the Constitution," Bush 
said.
