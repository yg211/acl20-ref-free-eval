THE SUPREME COURT LIST EXPANDS BY MARIANNE MEANS
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>

<P>
Just when we thought there was no new speculation
about President Bush's pending replacement of Sandra Day O'Connor on
the Supreme Court, along comes a surprise.
</P>
<P>
During the president's politically correct consultation with the bipartisan Senate leadership
this week, several senators urged that someone be considered who
is not already on a lower federal bench, the customary
source of previous appointments. A non-judge! What a concept.
</P>
<P>
The president apparently welcomed the suggestion, although the names being circulated
so far in public all wear black robes or did
so in the past. "Would I be willing to consider
people who had never been a judge? The answer is:
You bet," Bush told reporters. He indicated he was already
doing so. "We're considering all kinds of people -- judges,
non-judges."
</P>
<P>
The idea is that a little hands-on political experience, such as
O'Connor had in the Arizona state legislature before becoming a
state court judge, might help the nominee reach sensible judicial
judgments the country can support.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted
that career lawyers spend too much time with "footnotes and
semicolons" and have "very little contact with people." Sen. Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., added that he approved of going "outside the
judicial monastery."
</P>
<P>
This is not as shocking an idea as it seems at
first blush. Chief Justice William Rehnquist, for example, was tapped
by President Richard Nixon while an assistant attorney general.
</P>
<P>
Legal historians point out that of the 108 justices who have
served on the Supreme Court, only 48 were actually drawn
from the ranks of sitting judges. The others have been
practicing lawyers, attorneys general, Cabinet officers, senators, members of the
House, governors, solicitors general and law professors.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Constitution does not even require high court justices to
have a law degree. It merely says that judges, "both
of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices
during good behavior."
</P>
<P>
The court under Chief Justice Earl Warren is an example of
judicial diversity that has stood the test of time. That
court handed down the landmark Brown vs. Board of Education
ruling outlawing school segregation.
</P>
<P>
Although the Brown decision temporarily caused widespread social turmoil and President
Dwight D. Eisenhower later complained that his decision to nominate
Warren was his biggest mistake, the unanimous ruling was gradually
accepted as the law of the land. Warren was a
former governor and unsuccessful vice presidential candidate and the court
included three former U.S. senators. Their background meant "you had
a broader experience," Specter observed.
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist's bout with thyroid cancer and sudden, short hospital stay this
week for a fever have created a spike in speculation
that Bush may have two vacancies to fill before the
new court term begins in October. That would give him
an opportunity to name simultaneously both a judge and a
non-judge, broadening the public appeal of his choices.
</P>
<P>
This adds a new dimension to the partisan argument about whether
any new justice should reveal his or her ideological leanings
or be judged only on that vague category, "character."
</P>
<P>
A non-judge would have a different sort of record than a
legal scholar, reflecting political choices made in real life with
real consequences, instead of writings full of abstract philosophical theory.
</P>
<P>
So whose name might join the gossip circus now? Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has openly
lusted for a court seat. Although an ultraconservative, he is
fair-minded and could be easily confirmed. Alas, he is 71
years old, a tad ancient for a lifetime seat the
president sees as an important part of his historical legacy.
</P>
<P>
There are other sitting senators as well who are not extremists
and could serve honorably with dignity.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., a moderate and a leader of the
bi-partisan "gang of 14" that derailed a GOP Senate move
to kill the right to filibuster judicial nominations, might be
an acceptable bipartisan compromise. That would also open up a
Democratic seat in a red state that Republicans might recapture.
</P>
<P>
First Lady Laura Bush is publicly plumping for a woman to
replace O'Connor, but gender is not foremost in the minds
of most legal interest groups. Bush says he will consider
picking a female, but he seems more interested in naming
a Hispanic male -- perhaps Attorney General Alberto Gonzales. Bush
is also getting advice from an unusual quarter, the current
Supreme Court justices. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said
that at a recent luncheon, some of the justices said
they would prefer "somebody new on the court" rather than
more appellate judges who "sit in their offices and read
briefs."
</P>
<P>
Despite the importance of the work, it can obviously get boring
within those marble judicial halls. Not much dancing in the
aisles. But a lot of people would figuratively kill to
get there anyway.
