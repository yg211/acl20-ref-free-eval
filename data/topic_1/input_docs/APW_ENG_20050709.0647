The new Supreme Court justice must be a strong advocate for civil rights, and
NAACP members are pressuring lawmakers to make that a priority in the selection
process, NAACP officials said at the group's annual convention
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We very badly want to support a nominee committed to justice and fair play,"
said Julian Bond, chairman of the board of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People. "We don't want to have to oppose a nominee who is
opposed to those things. ... We hope to support someone who brings the country
together rather than drives the country apart."
</P>
<P>
Bond's comments came on the opening day of the group's 96th annual convention,
where more than 8,000 people are expected to discuss issues such as reparations
for slavery, renewal of the voting rights act and ways of increasing
membership.
</P>
<P>
The gathering comes as the group works to overcome budget shortfalls and recover
from allegations that its former president, Kweisi Mfume, played favorites among
employees and mismanaged the national staff. It is also fighting an
investigation by the Internal Revenue Service, which claims that NAACP
officials' strong criticisms of the Bush administration violated the group's
nonprofit status.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Baltimore-based nonprofit selected a new president, Bruce S.
Gordon, who will start in the job Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a seminar will focus on who will fill the Supreme Court seat that
will be vacated by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who announced her retirement
July 1. NAACP members are being urged to contact the White House and their
senators to influence selection of the nominee, said Hilary Shelton, head of the
NAACP's Washington, D.C., branch.
</P>
<P>
"We've educated our members on this," Shelton said. "We've been doing this ever
since we knew the chief justice (William Rehnquist) had thyroid
cancer."
</P>
<P>
The convention also will highlight the persistent health disparities between
blacks and other groups, with panel discussions, free health screenings and
fitness sessions planned each day.
</P>
<P>
"African Americans have the worst health outcomes of all groups," said Evelyn
Lewis, a physician with Pfizer Inc., a pharmaceutical company, who spoke on a
panel Saturday. "This is a civil rights issue."
</P>
<P>
The NAACP's health committee is investigating how well hospitals address racial
gaps _ particularly by having black physicians on staff _ and it will grade
hospitals in a report card to be released next year, said Rupert Richardson, an
NAACP board member from Louisiana and chairwoman of the group's national health
committee.
</P>
<P>
"This is a problem everywhere," Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
NAACP officials also announced that Howard Dean, chair of the Democratic
National Committee, and Ken Mehlman, chair of the Republican National Committee,
will participate in a discussion on political issues on Thursday.
