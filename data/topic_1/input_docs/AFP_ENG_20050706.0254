<P>
US President George W. Bush on 
Wednesday chastised critics of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales as 
a potential candidate for the recently-vacated seat in the Supreme 
Court.
</P>
<P>
"I don't like it when a friend gets criticized. I'm loyal to my 
friends," the US leader said of Gonzales during a brief stop in 
Denmark on Wednesday before attending the G8 summit in Scotland.  
</P>
<P>
Republicans and Democrats are geared up for a major political 
fight over a successor to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, 
who announced her retirement last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The vacancy handed Bush his first chance to reshape the 
ideological balance of the nine-member high court, which has immense 
influence over the lives of Americans as it interprets the 
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Liberals warned Bush not to name an "extremist" who could 
undermine women's right to have an abortion, while Republicans have 
urged him to pick a strict conservative.
</P>
<P>
Speculation has circled around Gonzales, who has been criticized 
by both liberals and conservatives, especially for his role in the 
controversial US policy towards terrorist suspects in captivity.
</P>
<P>
"(A)ll of a sudden this fellow, who is a good public servant and 
a really fine person, is under fire... I don't like it at all," Bush 
told reporters gathered outside Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh 
Rasmussen's country residence, just north of Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
The US leader also reiterated that there would be "no litmus 
test" on controversial issues like abortion or gay marriage for 
nominees to the Supreme Court position.
</P>
<P>
"(A)s I said during both of my campaigns, there will be no 
litmus test.  I'll pick people who... will strictly interpret the 
Constitution and not use the bench to legislate from," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bush's visit, his first to Denmark but his fifth meeting with 
Rasmussen since 2002, was seen by commentators as a symbolic gesture 
thanking Denmark for supporting the war in Iraq, where it has 
deployed more than 500 troops near the southern city of Basra.
