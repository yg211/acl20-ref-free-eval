resigns

WASHINGTON, July 2
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
US Republicans and Democrats geared 
up Saturday for a major political battle over a successor to Supreme 
Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who has announced her 
retirement.
</P>
<P>
Her decision, announced Friday, handed President George W. Bush 
his first chance to reshape the ideological balance of the court, 
which has immense influence over the lives of Americans, interprets 
the constitution and acts as a court of last resort.
</P>
<P>
Minutes after O'Connor's announcement, political leaders and 
lobby groups fired the first shots in a long brewing battle for the 
court's political soul.
</P>
<P>
Liberals warned Bush not to name an "extremist" while 
Republicans urged him to pick someone who would apply rather than 
interpret the constitution -- in other words a strict conservative.
</P>
<P>
"The nation deserves and I will select a Supreme Court justice 
that Americans can be proud of," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
"The nation also deserves a dignified process of confirmation in 
the United States Senate, characterised by fair treatment, a fair 
hearing and a fair vote," Bush said in a statement delivered in the 
White House Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
Bush said he would pick a new justice in a "timely manner" but 
the White House said there would be no announcement before he 
returns from next week's G8 summit in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The president was set to pore over profiles of potential Supreme 
Court picks during the long flight to Europe, his spokesman Scott 
McClellan said.
</P>
<P>
No official announcement has been made. But the most frequently 
mentioned names include Attorney General Alberto Gonzales as well as 
federal appeals court judges Michael Luttig, Harvie Wilkinson, John 
Roberts and former solicitor general Theodore Olson.
</P>
<P>
Justices are not term limited, so presidents have a chance to 
mould the country for years after they leave the political scene, 
through their court choices.
</P>
<P>
Bush's chance to remake the court is all the more important 
because key cases on abortion, assisted suicide and gay rights are 
looming when justices return from their summer break in October.
</P>
<P>
Democratic activists fear that Bush will replace O'Connor, who 
cast the key votes in two key abortion rights test cases in 2000, 
with a 'pro-life' justice.
</P>
<P>
O'Connor, a snowy haired 75-year-old judge and former 
prosecutor, told Bush her retirement would become effective upon the 
confirmation of a successor.
</P>
<P>
"It has been a great privilege indeed to have served as a member 
of the Court for 24 terms," she wrote in a letter to Bush.
</P>
<P>
"I will leave it with enormous respect for the integrity of the 
Court and its role under our constitutional structure," wrote 
O'Connor, who was born in Texas and practiced law in the 
southwestern state of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
Bush and O'Connor spoke in what aides said was an "emotional" 
phone call. With a nod to their shared Texas heritage, Bush said: 
"for an old ranching girl, you turned out pretty good," according to 
McClellan.
</P>
<P>
O'Connor was appointed by president Ronald Reagan and took her 
seat in September 1981.
</P>
<P>
She often sided with more radical conservatives on the court, as 
when she voted with the majority to stop recounts in Florida after 
the 2000 election, effectively handing the White House to Bush over 
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
Cancer-stricken Chief Justice William Rehnquist had been seen as 
the most likely justice to retire, but has so far made no 
announcement on his future.
</P>
<P>
O'Connor's retirement opens the first vacancy on the Supreme 
Court in 11 years. The last justice appointed was the liberal 
Justice Stephen Breyer, who was named by president Bill Clinton and 
he took his seat in August 1994.
</P>
<P>
It leaves Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the sole woman on the 
nine justice Supreme Court bench.
</P>
<P>
Senator Edward Kennedy called on Bush to appoint someone who 
could be embraced by all Americans.
</P>
<P>
"President Bush is faced with a decision that affects each and 
every American," warned the Massachusetts Democrat.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist said: "America 
needs judges who are fair, independent, unbiased and committed to 
equal justice under the law."
